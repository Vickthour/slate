emojidex [Anti] Code of Conduct
===============================

The emojidex project deals with emoji, which have a unique duality in that they are both objects 
of speech and objects of expression. As such, Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Expression are 
integral concepts in the existence, extension and propagation of emoji. As a "Code of Conduct" 
is a tool used to censor speech or expression and expel contributors, creators, or community 
members based not on their merits but rather their beliefs, opinions, views, and/or how they 
choose to speak or express those views; the emojidex project feels it would be antithetical to 
the principals of the project to include a Code of Conduct.
  
Please note, however, that the lack of a Code of Conduct does not mean emojidex forums/issue 
trackers/public points of discussion or communities will not be without occasional moderation. At 
the discretion of the core emojidex team, personal attacks between contributors may be moderated 
and contributions found antithetical or undesirable to the project may be rejected. As a caveat 
to this, please note that we will often consider an attempt to censor a contributor for their 
views, beliefs, sexuality or identity or things they have said/expressed in a public forum to be 
a personal attack.
