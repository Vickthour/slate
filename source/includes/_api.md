# API
<aside class="notice">
This documenation is for Version 1 of the API.
</aside>

This documentation covers access and usage of emojidex service utilizing the API and CDN.

## HTTP Requests
`https://www.emojidex.com/api/v1`

The API must always be called through HTTPS/SSL. This is to prevent leaking of user auth 
tokens and generally to keep as much information as to how users use emojidex as private 
as possible.

## HTTP Verbs
Throughout most of the API different actions are mapped to different HTTP verbs, such as GET, 
PUT, POST, DELETE. You MUST be aware of what verb you are using to make an API request, as most 
of the time only one HTTP verb will perform the task you want in your query.

## Authentication

> Token acquisition:

```shell
curl -X GET www.emojidex.com/api/v1/users/authenticate -d email=whoever@emojidex.com -d password=********
# or
curl -X GET www.emojidex.com/api/v1/users/authenticate -d username=WhoEver -d password=********
# or
curl -X GET www.emojidex.com/api/v1/users/authenticate -d user=whoever@emojidex.com -d password=********
# or
curl -X GET www.emojidex.com/api/v1/users/authenticate -d user=WhoEver -d password=********
```

```ruby
# coming soon
```

```javascript
// Using the emojidex-web-client
emojidex = new EmojidexClient();
emojidex.User.login({'authtype': 'plain', 'username': 'MeMeMe', 'password': '******'});
```

```java
// coming soon
```

> Token confirmation:

```shell
curl -X GET www.emojidex.com/api/v1/users/authenticate -d username=MeMeMe -d token=0123456789abcdef
```

```ruby
# coming soon
```

```javascript
// Using the emojidex-web-client
// coming soon
```

```java
// coming soon
```

> When authentication / confirmation succeeds something like the following JSON is returned:

```json
{"auth_status":"verified","auth_user":"MyUserName","auth_token":"0123456789abcdef",
"pro":false,"pro_exp":null,"premium":true,"premium_exp":1467431422, "r18":false}
```

> When authentication fails the follwing JSON is returned:

```json
{"auth_status":"unverified","auth_token":null}
```

> Token utilization example:

```shell
curl -X GET https://www.emojidex.com/api/v1/users/favorites -d auth_token=1234567890abcdef
```

```ruby
```

```javascript
// the emojidex web client will automatically insert auth keys for you
```

```java
```

### Auth Tokens
Each user is granted an auth token which gives them access to their own personal resources. 
Each user account is granted one and only one token which can be used by multiple clients, 
does not expire, but can be refreshed/changed.  
  
<aside class="notice">
The tokens issued and used in V1 of the API are "level 1" tokens. 
They do not grant access to any resources which contain personally identifying information,
nor any resources that allow a user to make payments or change account details such as 
passwords. The worst that can happen from a stolen token is having favorites added or removed, 
or items added to a users history.
</aside>

<aside class="warning">
Utilizing auth tokens to add or remove favorites or add to history without a users consent may 
violate usage licenses of emojidex. emojidex may take legal action against anyone found abusing 
access to users auth tokens without first notifying the user and/or obtaining their consent.
</aside>

Tokens are returned as a response from a valid authorization request. Users can view, re-set, 
or revoke their auth token from the User Details section after they log in to the 
emojidex web site. Auth tokens can not be changed through the API. 
As a single auth token is granted per user and shared between apps, the revocation or 
re-generation of a token will require re-acquisition in all clients.
Not all API calls require authentication, but all API calls can and should be performed with 
authentication tokens included when a token is available. 

### Authenticating / Obtaining a user auth token from the API
You can authenticate through the API using a username and password or e-mail and password. 
It is also possible to check authentication and update user details using the username and token. 
To authenticate you must make a call to /api/v1/users/authenticate with an appropriate 
combination of the following parameters:

*Parameters*

Name | Type | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
username | string | The username registered to the user (paired with password or token)
email | string | The e-mail address of the user (paired with password)
user | string | The username or e-mail address of the user (paired with password)
password | string | The password of the user (paired with username or e-mail)
token | string | The authentication token (paired with username)

<aside class="notice">
There is no inherent demerit to using "user" rather than "username" or "email", but we 
generally recommend using a username as it is not directly personally identifying and 
it is the only part of a user account that can not be changed and remains static.
</aside>

Upon a successful authentication request the following information will be returned:

*Return Data*

‚îèauth_status: the status code of the authorization ("verified" or "unverified")  
‚î£auth_user: the username of the account just verified  
‚î£auth_token: the auth token for this account  
‚î£pro: true or false value specifying if pro status is currently active  
‚î£pro_exp: expiration date of current or previous pro status (null if never active)  
‚î£premium: true or false value specifying if premium status is currently active  
‚î£premium_exp: expiration date of current or previous premium status (null if never active)  
‚îór18: true or false value specifying if user wants to view R-18 content  

<aside class="warning">
DO NOT store a users password. ALWAYS use an auth token. ONLY pass the password to the API when 
you are obtaining an auth token. Store auth tokens as securely as possible!
</aside>

```json
/* ... indicates truncation, the actual data does not have a ... */
{
  /* useful for REGEX checking/filtering */
  "moji_string":"‚õ≤‚õ≥‚õ∫‚õΩ‚úÖ‚úâ‚úå„ÄΩÔ∏è...",
  /* useful for manual scanning */
  "moji_array":["Ô∏è1Ô∏è‚É£","Ô∏è2Ô∏è‚É£","Ô∏è3Ô∏è‚É£","Ô∏è4Ô∏è‚É£","Ô∏è5Ô∏è‚É£","Ô∏è6Ô∏è‚É£","Ô∏è7Ô∏è‚É£","Ô∏è8Ô∏è‚É£", ...],

}
```

> Get moji code indexes with Japanese codes

```shell
curl -X GET https://www.emojidex.com/api/v1/moji_codes -d locale=ja

Generally you'll want to have a selection of emoji available immediately. Usually that will at least 
consist of the standardized UTF/Unicode emoji. A semi-static index is available at api/v1/utf_emoji .
If you only need the codes, a combined string for regex filtering, or an index of character code to 
emoji short code, these all come in the data available from api/v1/moji_codes . The emojidex branded 
extended emoji are also available from api/v1/extended_emoji. All of these end points are compatible 
with the locale option.

```

> Search for emoji with code starting with "heart"

```shell
curl -X GET https://www.emojidex.com/api/v1/search/emoji -d code_sw=heart
```

```javascript
emojidex.Search.starting("heart");
```

> Search for emoji with code ending with "heart"

```shell
curl -X GET https://www.emojidex.com/api/v1/search/emoji -d code_ew=heart
```

```javascript
emojidex.Search.ending("heart");
```

> Search for emoji with codes containing "heart" in the category "faces"

```shell
curl -X GET https://www.emojidex.com/api/v1/search/emoji -d code_cont=heart -d categories\[\]=faces
```

```javascript
emojidex.Search.advanced("heart", [], ['faces']);
```

> Search for emoji with codes containing "heart" in either the category "faces" or "abstract"

```shell
curl -X GET https://www.emojidex.com/api/v1/search/emoji -d code_cont=heart -d categories\[\]=faces -d categories\[\]=abstract
```

```javascript
emojidex.Search.advanced("heart", [], ['faces', 'abstract']);
```

> Search for emoji with tag "weapon" 

```shell
curl -X GET https://www.emojidex.com/api/v1/search/emoji -d tags\[\]=weapon
```

```javascript
emojidex.Search.tags(["weapon"]);
```

> Search for emoji where code contains "rifle", has the tag "weapon", and is in category "tools"

```shell
curl -X GET https://www.emojidex.com/api/v1/search/emoji -d code_cont=rifle -d tags\[\]=weapon -d categories\[\]=tools
```

```javascript
emojidex.Search.advanced("rifle", ['weapon'], ['tools']);
```

The basis for emoji searches is search by emoji code. Searches can be performed for 
codes that contain a term, start with a term, or end with a term. Alternatively, 
you can serch for tags, or you can combine a code search with tags to restrict search 
results to emoji containging the term which also have the tags specified. Additionally, 
searches can be restricted to one or more categories, where results will only be emoji 
present in the categories specified. In general, more tags specified means a more 
specific search with fewer results. And, in general, the more categories specified the 
more generalized the search and therefore more results. When no categories or tags are 
specified the search will not be restricted to any categories or tags and will return 
all results for the term specified.

The API endpoint for searches is /search/emoji.

*Predicates*
Predicates are added to the code field to specify the search type, such as "\[q\]\[code_cont\]" 
to "query for codes which contain" the specified term.

Predicate | Meaning | Description
---- | ---- | -----------
cont | Contains | Contains the search term somewhere in the code.
sw | Starts With | Code starts with the term.
ew | Ends With | Code ends with the term.

<aside class="notice">
There is no "exact match" search because simply hitting https://www.emojidex.com/api/v1/emoji/#code 
will achieve the same thing - it directly checks for the emoji with that code (replacing #code with 
the code you are checking for).
</aside>

*Search Fields*

tags[] | An array of tags to search by or to limit results to.
categories[] | An array of categories to limit the search domain.

```json
{"emoji":[{"code":"Âπª","moji":null,"unicode":null,"category":"abstract","tags":[],"link":null,
"base":"Âπª","variants":["Âπª","Âπª(ÁôΩ)"],"score":0},{"code":"pink poo","moji":null,
"unicode":null,"category":"abstract","tags":[],"link":null,"base":"pink_poo",
"variants":["pink_poo"],"score":340}],"meta":{"count":2,"total_count":2,"page":1}}
```

You can get all emoji registered by a specific user.  
Some special user accounts exist from which you can get the current UTF 
index, emojidex original extended emoji, etc. These accounts are as 
follows:

  * emoji: All UTF/Unicode emoji with English emoji codes
  * emojidex: All emojidex original extended emoji with English emoji codes
  * ÁµµÊñáÂ≠ó: UTF/Unicode emoji with Japanese emoji codes
  * ÁµµÊñáÂ≠ó„Éá„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Çπ: emojidex original extended emoji with Japanese emoji codes

However, this information can also be obtained from the emoji Seed paths in one 
call without pagination (see above).
