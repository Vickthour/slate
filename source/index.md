# Introduction
About emojidex
--------------
emojidex is the worlds first emoji-as-a-service provider as well as an extremely Open Source 
friendly set of tools and assets. We appreciate your interest in emjidex and want 
you to know that the vast majority of profit from emojidex are used to support a variety of Open 
Source software projects, educational material development, research projects and more. By using
emojidex in your project you are helping support Open Source, global education, and a variety of
good and interesting scientific and engineering causes.  

The emojidex Service
--------------------
emojidex is primarily based around the [emojidex service](https://www.emojidex.com). This service
offers an API with listing, search and registration services. Some services require a token to 
access [registration for example] or for certain types of access [search with over 100 results 
per page and other queries that could be overused]. These limitations are only to prevent abuse 
or overuse of the system.

emojidex Tools and Clients
--------------------------
emojidex offers a set of clients and tools that can be found in the 
[emojidex organization](https://github.com/emojidex/) on github. The core tool and model for 
emojidex is the [emojidex gem for Ruby](https://github.com/emojidex/emojidex). This is the basis 
of not only online and backend tools but also the majority of the tools for emojidex such as the 
converter and the desktop client/editor. For Java/Android there's 
[emojidex android](https://github.com/emojidex/emojidex). 

emojidex on a Web Site
----------------------
The [emojidex Coffee](https://github.com/emojidex/emojidex-coffee) client is a front end client 
and tool set, developed in Coffee Script, and distributed as a jQuery plug-in. Using emojidex 
to automatically convert emoji character codes on your web site and use emoji assets in or as
widgets, and to enter and parse text with emoji is made as easy as simple as possible. All emoji 
are obtained from the content delivery network for the emojidex Service so you don't need to 
cache any emoji on your server or worry about any assets or images on your own server.

# API
<aside class="notice">
This documenation is for Version 1 of the API.
</aside>

This documentation covers access and usage of emojidex service utilizing the API and CDN.

## HTTP Requests
`https://www.emojidex.com/api/v1`

The API must always be called through HTTPS/SSL. This is to prevent leaking of user auth 
tokens and generally to keep as much information as to how users use emojidex as private 
as possible.

## HTTP Methods
Throughout most of the API different actions are mapped to different HTTP Methods, such as GET, 
PUT, POST, DELETE. You MUST be aware of what method you are using to make an API request, as most 
of the time only one HTTP method will perform the task you want in your query.

## API Keys
Coming soon. For now you do not need to set an API key.

## Authentication
Not all API calls require authentication, but all API calls can be performed with authentication 
tokens included. Generally if a user has an auth token it should be used with every call.

To authenticate you must add the "user" and "auth_token" fields to the request. The "user" field
is the user name, and the auth_token can be obtained with an authorize request.
<aside class="warning">
DO NOT store a users password. ALWAYS use an auth token. ONLY pass the password to the API when 
you are obtaining an auth token. Store auth tokens as securely as possible!
</aside>

### Obtain a Token
To obtain a token TODO

> Token acquisition:

### Using a Token

> Token utilization:

```ruby
```

```js
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "www.emojidex.com/api/v1"
  -H ""
```

## Current emoji Index
Gets a general index of popular and new emoji.

```ruby
```

```js
```

```shell

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffums",
    "breed": "calico",
    "fluffiness": 6,
    "cuteness": 7
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Isis",
    "breed": "unknown",
    "fluffiness": 5,
    "cuteness": 10
  }
]
```
#Assets

## Assets [CDN] Address
`http://assets.emojidex.com`

Note that this is not (currently) an HTTPS address. Assets are hosted on an S3 instance. 
In the future we will try to rig SSL up to the assets subdomain but at the moment SSL 
can optionally be used by allowing certs from the \*.s3.amazon.com address.

## Asset Access / Layout

Assets can be found on the Content Delivery Network under structured 
directories.

Each emoji asset is composed of the emoji code, with spaces represented as underscores. 
For example, the emoji code "blush" would have PNG images named "blush.png".

All emoji on www.emojidex.com can be found under /emoji, with the root /emoji containing SVG 
images:  
`http://assets.emojidex.com/emoji/blush.svg`  
![blush emoji](http://assets.emojidex.com/emoji/blush.svg)

PNG images come in a variety of sizes:  
```
{ ldpi: 9, mdpi: 18, hdpi: 27, xhdpi: 36, px8: 8,
  px16: 16, px32: 32, px64: 64, px128: 128, px256: 256 }
```  
Each emoji size is squared (wide emoji coming soon!). An emoji in a particular size is always
guarnteed to have the height specified for its size. For example, LDPI emoji are always 9px 
high.

![blush emoji](http://assets.emojidex.com/emoji/px256/blush.png) | px256 | http://assets.emojidex.com/emoji/px256/blush.png

<aside class="warning">
Only obtian the images you need only in the size that matches your use case or the nearest size 
that is larger than your use case.
</aside>
<aside class="warning">
Do not agressively download/cache emoji you may not be displaying. If you are going to pre-cache 
some emoji images please limit it to only a few (eg. 10 or less).
</aside>

In general small text will usually be best with an emoji 
size of about mdpi ![blush emoji](http://assets.emojidex.com/emoji/mdpi/blush.png). Regular text, 
as in text that is readable on most mobile handsets without zooming, will usually be around hdpi 
![blush emoji](http://assets.emojidex.com/emoji/hdpi/blush.png).
