The source for this document can be found [here](https://github.com/emojidex/slate).  
Amemendments and fixes are welcome! Please either fork/fix/push/pull requet or submit an issue 
on github if you find anything lacking or requiring a cleaner/better explanation.

The emojidex Service
--------------------
emojidex is primarily based around the [emojidex service](https://www.emojidex.com). This service
offers an API with listing, search and registration services. Some services require a token to 
access [registration for example] or for certain types of access [search with over 100 results 
per page and other queries that could be overused]. These limitations are only to prevent abuse 
or overuse of the system.

emojidex Tools and Clients
--------------------------
emojidex offers a set of clients and tools that can be found in the 
[emojidex organization](https://github.com/emojidex/) on github. The core tool and model for 
emojidex is the [emojidex gem for Ruby](https://github.com/emojidex/emojidex). This is the basis 
of not only online and backend tools but also the majority of the tools for emojidex such as the 
converter and the desktop client/editor. For Java/Android there's 
[emojidex android](https://github.com/emojidex/emojidex). 

emojidex on a Web Site
----------------------
The [emojidex Coffee](https://github.com/emojidex/emojidex-coffee) client is a front end client 
and tool set, developed in Coffee Script, and distributed as a jQuery plug-in. Using emojidex 
to automatically convert emoji character codes on your web site and use emoji assets in or as
widgets, and to enter and parse text with emoji is made as easy as simple as possible. All emoji 
are obtained from the content delivery network for the emojidex Service so you don't need to 
cache any emoji on your server or worry about any assets or images on your own server.
